# Lakehopper

Lakehopper is my ongoing long-term project to create a solar-powered 
autonomous MAV that rests on lakes during nights and overcast days.

I essentially want to make a migrating bird that survives off of photosynthesis.

That goal is a bit lofty, so I'm doing this by working towards four
different milestones.

## Milestones

### MAV

The first milestone is to build a flying MAV.


### Lake hopping

Lake hopping involves:
- Waterproofing
- Water landings
- Water takeoffs


### Solar power

'Solar power' in my context means endless flight with breaks when necessary.

A plane that needs to charge for a week and can then do a two hour flight would
not be ideal but still pass. My ideal power generation graph however would 
probably look something like this:


### Autonomy

The autonomy milestone can be subdivided into automatic flight,
water landings and takeoffs, and navigation.

I will not be implementing automatic flight myself. This will be handled by the
[Ardupilot](https://ardupilot.org) autopilot software.
